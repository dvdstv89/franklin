# Drones API

This project implements a REST API service in ASP.NET Core Web API, using .NET 7, to manage a set of drones responsible for delivering medicines. Drones can register, load medications, and perform various operations related to their status and cargo.

## Previous requirements
	Make sure you have the following installed: .NET 7 SDK

## Database Configuration

The project uses an in-memory database, so no additional configuration is required. The necessary data is loaded automatically when you start the application.

## Database Structure

### The database has the following entities:

	  Drone
	  {
	    SerialNumber(PK) : string (cadena de hasta 100 caracteres)
	    Model : Enum (Lightweight = 1, Middleweight = 2, Cruiserweight = 3, Heavyweight = 4)
	    WeightLimit : double (Range 1 : 500 gr)
	    BatteryCapacity : double (Range 0:100)
	    State : Enum (IDLE = 1, LOADING = 2, LOADED = 3, DELIVERING = 4, DELIVERED = 5, RETURNING = 6)
	  }
	
	  Medication
	  {
	    Code(PK) : string (allowed only letters, numbers, ‘-‘, ‘_’)
	    Name : (allowed only upper case letters, underscore and numbers)
	    Weight : double (Range 1 : 500 gr)	
	    Image : byte[]
	  }
	
	  Many-to-many relationship between Drones and Medicines count an attribute in the relationship to know the amount of a medicine loaded in the drone
	
	  DroneMedication 
	  {	
	    DroneSerialNumber : string
	    MedicationCode : string
	    Count: int
	  }
	
	  PeriodicTaskLog
	  {
	    Id : GUID
	    SerialNumber : string
	    BatteryCapacity : double
	    Date : DateTime
	  }		

### Initial Data Set
When you start the application, a sample data set is automatically loaded to ensure a functional environment for testing and demonstrations.
This data set includes:
	
  Drones
	
    Drone { SerialNumber = "DRN001", Model = DroneModel.Lightweight, WeightLimit = 100, BatteryCapacity = 80, State = DroneState.IDLE }
    Drone { SerialNumber = "DRN002", Model = DroneModel.Lightweight, WeightLimit = 175, BatteryCapacity = 70, State = DroneState.LOADED }
    Drone { SerialNumber = "DRN003", Model = DroneModel.Middleweight, WeightLimit = 250, BatteryCapacity = 18, State = DroneState.RETURNING }
    Drone { SerialNumber = "DRN004", Model = DroneModel.Middleweight, WeightLimit = 300, BatteryCapacity = 23, State = DroneState.RETURNING }
    Drone { SerialNumber = "DRN005", Model = DroneModel.Cruiserweight, WeightLimit = 350, BatteryCapacity = 40, State = DroneState.IDLE }
    Drone { SerialNumber = "DRN006", Model = DroneModel.Cruiserweight, WeightLimit = 400, BatteryCapacity = 5, State = DroneState.IDLE }
    Drone { SerialNumber = "DRN007", Model = DroneModel.Cruiserweight, WeightLimit = 325, BatteryCapacity = 75, State = DroneState.IDLE }
    Drone { SerialNumber = "DRN008", Model = DroneModel.Heavyweight, WeightLimit = 500, BatteryCapacity = 80, State = DroneState.IDLE }
    Drone { SerialNumber = "DRN009", Model = DroneModel.Heavyweight, WeightLimit = 480, BatteryCapacity = 98, State = DroneState.IDLE }
    Drone { SerialNumber = "DRN010", Model = DroneModel.Heavyweight, WeightLimit = 500, BatteryCapacity = 100, State = DroneState.IDLE }

    Medication { Code = "MED007", Name = "MedicationG", Weight = 50, Image = new byte[] { 255, 255, 255, 255 } }
    Medication { Code = "MED008", Name = "MedicationH", Weight = 75, Image = new byte[] { 255, 255, 255, 255 } }
    Medication { Code = "MED009", Name = "MedicationI", Weight = 57, Image = new byte[] { 255, 255, 255, 255 } }
    Medication { Code = "MED010", Name = "MedicationJ", Weight = 40, Image = new byte[] { 255, 255, 255, 255 } }

# Periodic Battery Log Task

The system includes a periodic task that records the battery status of all drones every 10 seconds and saves them in a table called PeriodicTaskLog.

# Testing execution

	Make sure you have the following installed: .NET 7 SDK

52 test cases have been prepared to ensure the functionality and stability of the service.
These test cases cover various aspects of the system, including drone registration, medication loading, load verification on specific drones, and battery monitoring.

The test cases are located in the "test" directory of the project and can be run using the command:


## Navigate to the test project directory
	cd drones/drones.API.test

## Run the tests
	dotnet test

Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:    52, Skipped:     0, Total:    52, Duration: 761 ms - drones.API.test.dll (net7.0)
